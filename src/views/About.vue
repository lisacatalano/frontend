    <div class="content">
      <p>I have been a web developer for over a decade. I started with PHP and then moved to the front-end and JavaScript. Most of my work has been with smaller teams, which has allowed me to touch all aspects of the front end, including designing responsive interfaces, writing HTML and CSS, creating build processes, and writing tests. I previously worked as a software consultant doing work for a wide variety of clients in many different industries using the Progress 4GL and RDBMS.</p>
      <p>I have simultaneously pursued my interest in design by studying both Interior and Graphic Design. I have a good mixture of creative and technical skills making me well suited to working as a web developer.</p>
      <p>Another skill I bring is teaching and mentoring. I've taught AutoCAD and Photoshop in classrooms and I also create on-line tutorials and courses. Figuring out how to explain complex topics in logical ways to new users is something I enjoy.</p>
